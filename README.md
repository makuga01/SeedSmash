# SeedSmash v 0.3 BETA

This tool sends requests with fake upload to torrents announce.
I know this is kind of fucking with the torrent community but i was bored and pissed at my favorite tracker that they restricted new torrents just for VIP users that I started working on this so i can get VIP on tracker for free :p and it's more than 1 year and I'm still not banned *yet*

Usage:
```usage: seedsmash.py [-h] --time TIME [--speed SPEED]
  --time TIME    Seed time in minutes
  
optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --speed SPEED  Upload speed in kBs default 1000
  ```

installing requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#Working:
- seeding one torrent for certain period of time - depends from announce

#Not working (TODO):

- seeding multiple torrents (Multi threading)
